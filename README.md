# Quantum Circuit Simulation with Filtering and Normalization

This repository contains a quantum circuit simulation using Qiskit. The project implements quantum gates, controlled operations, and ancilla-based filtering to analyze specific outcomes. The results are visualized as histograms, with options for filtering and normalization.

## Features
- Construction of a complex quantum circuit with ancilla-based operations.
- Simulation using the Qiskit Aer simulator.
- Filtering of results based on ancilla qubit states.
- Visualization of results as raw, filtered, and normalized histograms.
- Requirement dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- `pip` package manager

### Steps
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

1. Run the simulation:
   ```bash
   python your_script_name.py
   ```
   Replace `your_script_name.py` with the name of the Python file containing the simulation.

2. View the output:
   - Histograms of results (raw, filtered, and normalized) will be displayed side-by-side in a single plot.

3. Modify the circuit or parameters as needed in the script.
